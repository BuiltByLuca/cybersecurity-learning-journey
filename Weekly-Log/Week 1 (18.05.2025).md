# ðŸ“† Week 1 | 18.05.2025

This is my first week doing anything cyber security related. I already have a good knowledge of computers and some very very basic coding.
I will use this week to familiarize myself with the space of Cybersecurity. Learning what it is about, what I can do with it, and if I would even like to do it in the first place.

## Day 1 | ðŸ•‘ Roughly 4 Hours

1. Start TryHackMe [Pre-Security Path](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity)
2. Completed Offensive Security Intro (Had to "hack" into a bank website that should not be able to be accessed by the public, and send money to an account.)
3. Completed Defensive Security Intro (Had to Learn about defensive security and Identify a malicious IP adress and add it to the firewall to block it.)
4. Completed Careers in Cyber Info (The Red Team role struck my interest.)
5. Completed "What is Networking?" Course.
     - Learned that ipv6 exists partially because we are running out of ipv4 Adresses. There are about 50 billion devices connected (as of 2021) but ipv4 can only have a maximum of 4.3 billion. Ipv6 however can theoretically support up to 340 trillion ip adresssed, which should be more than enough for quite some time xD (IPV6 also has some more features, but I didnt go over that yet)
     - MAC adresses are theoretically unique to each device, the first 3 coupples of numbers are the identifier for the company that made the internet acess device (lan port / wifi card in pc) and the last 3 are a theoretically unique identifier for each chip. The reason why it is theoretical is because the MAC can be spoofed, in which case you can have 2 of the same MAC adresses.

> Done all available free courses[^1] on TryHackMe. I'm not sure if I want to spend the 126â‚¬/Year just yet. I'd like to be more convinced to go on this entire journey before I start paying money for it.

- Started [Over The Wire Wargames (Bandit)](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) to learn more about linux commands and environments. Completed the first 7 Tasks.

     Using Ubuntu with WSL

## Day 2 | ðŸ•‘ Roughly 4 Hours

Just did a bunch more OverTheWire Bandit. Honestly it was really fun, but then level 12 or 13 came (I cant remember) and from then on out it just became extremly difficult to figure things out on my own. Sure I was able to Use outside sources to figure everything ouut, but no wonder I beat a riddle if I have the answers right in front of me. Kinda feels like cheating and not learning.. altough i think i did still learn.
