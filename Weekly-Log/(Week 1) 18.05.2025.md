# (Week 1) 18.05.2025

This is my first week doing anything cyber security related. I already have a good knowledge of computers and some very very basic coding.
I will use this week to familiarize myself with the space of Cybersecurity. Learning what it is about, what I can do with it, and if I would even like to do it in the first place.
