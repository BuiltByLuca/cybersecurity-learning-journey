# üìÜ Week 2 (26.05.25)

This week I will probably try everything that HackTheBox has to offer. I previously thought that HackTheBox was completly paid beacuse I couldn't quite find how to get to the courses, but after actually looking with my eyes open for 30 seconds, I managed to find it. I will be going throught the begginer Introductions and probably Offensive focused courses if possible. The reason I am no longer focusing on the Over the wire bandit courses is because I did not have the feeling of learning something that would be valuable for me.

I have also spent the last part of the week developing a python app that converts files into different file formats (.mp3 => .ogg)(available on my GitHub)

For this week though, If they have enough courses, I will continue with hackthebox. Below are all the completed courses:

## ‚úÖ Intro To Academy

- Basic Intro to how the platform works
- Learning about HTB Structure with learning modules
- Learned about a "money" system with what they call "cubes" that you get upon completing a module. Some modules are "free" rewarding 100% of cubes back to you once you complete them, some others cost cubes, only giving you 20% of what you paid to enter the module. This is to encentivise completing courses and prosumably completing challanges to earn more cubes.
- Learning about Theory and Interactive sections (pages in modules)
- Starting the first Pwnbox
- Getting first flag through a provided ip pasted in browser.
- other basic Info. discord and such.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Information Security Foudations

- To learn which path of Security I actually want to go in. Originally I wanted to go into Offensive, but since this course is recommended I think it might be a good idea just to do this so I can actually know for somewhat sure what I want to do.
- This is projected to take 10 Days.. we'll see how many notes I do during this.
-Way of thinking -- Optional Exercise: ```20 * ________+ ________ = 65535``` | I solved this by just doing 20*0 + 65535 because it is the simplest imo.
- Think outside the box -- Optional Exercise: The Question was why I didnt think to consider changing the arithmetic operations of the last exercise to solve it.. I'm supposed to write a whole novel here, but honestly I don't even know what arithmetic operations are. I dropped out of school, It didn't get into my head to consider changing something that I didn't know exists.. or how it works.
- Occam's Razor thinking.."The simplest explanation is always the most probable" but with some caveats.
- Added a quote: "A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation." To my notebook lol. this one is really good.
- Way Of Learning: What I want to achieve with this course in particular is learning what fields I want to enter in Cyber Security. What I precieve as something that is valuable enough for me, to devote hundreds of hours of my life into.
- Learning Pyramid: We were instructed to collect as much information as possible about the ["Learning Pyramid"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid) (side note, I am so happy they trust wikipedia.. I don't meet enough people who do. Thats a rant for another time though.) The learning pyramid suggests that doing something practically is far more engaging, thus you can remember it better than just reading about it, or listening to someone else talk about it. anyways, here's a picture so you can remember what I talked about just now :)![Learning Pyramid or Cone of Learning](<../Files/Learning Pyramid.jpeg>) I think that's good enough for now.
- Learning Types: Find the best way for us to think creatively: I think this one is an extremly hard and somewhat easy one at the same time. It's important to find yourself in a space when you can focus, but also be distracted enough to find yourself thinking about things. Lazer focus is damaging to creativity. You look at the light in the end of the tunnel, but don't realize the beautiful art lining the tunnel walls. The best way to think creatively is different for everyone. Some may find a flower on their desk to inspire creative thinking, some might need a scented candle, and others are just more creative. Personally though, a combination of all of the above and deep breathing does the trick if needed.
- Since there was a page on setting goals that I found really cool: A study with over 40.000 people found that 90% of people are more succesful if they set themselves goals.. (ITS INSANE) Anyways **my goal is to obtain a certification in offensive security.** the exect branch of it is for now not decided, but that is the goal.
- Decision Making talks about something that I have never really thought of in that way before. If we take the famous trolly problem where you can either switch a leaver to kill 1 person, or do nothing which will kill 5 people.. what do you do? well.. you drive a car infront of the trolly so it stops. This is what was talked about before with thinking outside of the box. Your goal might be one thing, but if you can think outisde of the box you might be able to solve something in a way that was not thought of. Of course this only works if the result is not static. Meaning if 1+1=2 I can't just imagine the "+" doesn't exist and say the answer is 11. Still just thinking outside of the box can be quite fun, challenging, and maybe more productive than thinking in a straight line.. also another thing; *nothing is impossible*; you simply aren't able to see the solution to a problem you are experiencing.
- no one will ever be able to question your success if you: Decide on the goal defined in detail that you really want to achieve from your heart, and that will make you happy consciously and subconsciously.
- After a feww hours of this course and getting to the third to last page of "learning Process" in the "Information Security Foundations" Path, I have to say that this is something that I really did not expect at all. The depth of psychological talks may be something that I get explained by a therapist, but not by a website about Cybersecurity. It is, though, very very welcome as I love diving into topics like this. They encurage my thinking and creative thinking positively and make me feel very productive in life. These are lessons that could not be more applicable throughout one's entire lifetime. Anyways after about 5 ish hours I am quite dranied and unable to focus on what "questioning" is trying to convey. I will continue this the next time.
- Learning more about asking questions, what questions are and how to ask the "right" ones. (Written in personal notes, not public.)
